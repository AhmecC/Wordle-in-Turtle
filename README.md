# Wordle-in-Turtle

Wordle created in turtle! Contains all words that the official game uses.

Potential Downside:
- text-input popup is needed for game to work. Typing a word that is not in the acceptable list doesn't let you immediately type another word but forces you to click the popup. This is annoying and ruins the user experience.
