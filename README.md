# Wordle-in-Turtle

Wordle created in turtle, it uses the same list that the official thing uses. 

A Potential downside is the fact that a text-input popup is needed for the game to work. If you type a word that is not in the acceptable list then the input box will not let you immediately start typing another word but you must click the relevant section which i believe ruins the user experience. I eventually want to recreate this in another module (potentially PyGame) to get as close as the original wordle (where letters appear on scren as you type).
